## Code Project Templates

Some of the sample templates I have collected to speed up prototyping, teaching
other developers, demoing organizational patterns and doing interview coding 
assignments (since the 100's of existing projects on my github just aren't 
enough proof)

Each branch in this repository is a different project shell. Many of them are
Go and Node.

1. checkout the repo
2. change to the branch you wish to use
3. delete the `.git` repo folder
4. run `git init` to start fresh with the empty shell
